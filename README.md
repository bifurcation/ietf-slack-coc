## Welcome!

The IETF has an [Anti-Harrassment Policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/anti-harassment-policy/) that describes the baseline expectations we have for participants in the IETF.  This document provides a Code of Conduct for the IETF Slack instance, which augments the anti-harrassment policy to make sure our Slack is a healthy and productive place for working together.  It specifically seeks to provide a welcoming, fun and productive environment for everyone.

We expect members of the IETF community to act in a way that creates and nurtures an environment which is harassment-free, safe, comfortable, and enjoyable to be a part of, whoever you are. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. We work hard on improving our plans, code, communications and designs - and we work just as hard on our culture. It is a work in progress, and this Code of Conduct is intended to help us hold to high standards and provide a clear framework for doing that.

The list of current admins can be found here: https://ietf.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins.

## Expected Behaviours

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture, one that nurtures the positive working relationships which help us break out of silos and strictures and create a better Internet. We want to support diversity in our teams, our thinking and ultimately in the Internet itself. We support an open exchange of ideas and we believe the following guidelines will help create spaces where everyone who is part of the IETF can feel confident that their input is valued and heard. By doing so we will help ensure we build the Internet we can, and maximise the impact of our work.

It would be impossible to list everything needed to create a welcoming, supportive space, but we encourage you to embrace these principles:

1. Generosity is the foundation of good collaboration; assume competence in each other.
2. Give and receive criticism with grace. Recognise good critiques are kind, clear, and constructive. Focus on goals and requirements rather than personal preferences.
3. Be polite, humble and friendly. Practice empathy and humility.
4. Listen carefully and actively. Seek to understand each other's context - ask questions because you want to hear the answer.
5. Earn your audience. Every act of speech requires an act of listening; create an environment where people are encouraged to listen as much as they speak.
6. Respect each others' time by doing research before asking questions that have been addressed before or in other channels.

## Unacceptable behaviour

To help participants understand behaviours that are unacceptable or run counter to our culture, we’ve listed below actions that violate our Ways of Working.

This list does not cover every case. Each person you interact with is unique, and as a result can define a line of unacceptable behaviour that’s unique to them. Ensuring that your behaviour does not have a negative impact is your responsibility.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, age, body size, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, employment, and political views.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual remarks, images or behaviour
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Unwanted publication of private communication
* Intentionally or repeatedly referring to people in a way that rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).
* Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include:
	* Patronizing language or behaviour
	* Pedantic corrections that don’t contribute to the conversation (For example: “Well actually’s…")
	* Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined or explained to them. (It’s great to be sensitive to the fact that people may not be familiar with technical terms you use every day. But assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.)
	* Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled ("So easy your grandmother could do it.")
	* Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else
	* Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic
	* The use of racially charged language to describe an individual or thing such as "thug" or “ghetto”
	* Referring to an individual in a way that demeans or challenges the validity of their racial identity
	* Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language.
* Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated these Ways of Working or the BBC Code of Conduct.

## Reporting

If you witness any inappropriate behaviour, or have any other concerns, please contact [the admins](https://ietf.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins) by sending them a direct message. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

The admins will respect confidentiality around issues. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. We may suggest that certain issues be escalated to the [IETF Ombudsteam](https://www.ietf.org/contact/ombudsteam/). 

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour must comply immediately.

If a participant engages in inappropriate behaviour, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender and removing them from the Slack entirely.

## Message Retention:

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack -- the company -- retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of this slack. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

## Privacy

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public.**  Membership is generally open, and any member can join a public channel.  We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.
